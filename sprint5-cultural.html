    <h1>Reflection on Core learning journey </h1>
   
    <div class="topic text-justify">
      <h3>
      Describe the impact the core learning has had on your Foundations learning journey.
      </h3>
    <p>
      Core learning has helped me form some habits that can develop a growth mindset.  Using these skills when working through coding challenges has been helpful to keep me moving forward when I feel overwhelmed.
    </p>

    <div class="topic text-justify">
      <h3>
        What are 1 - 3 new things you have learned about yourself as a result of the core learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        1. I learnt that if I keep putting the effort and time into a task I can learn more than I thought I could.
        <br>
        2. I can bounce back faster by allowing myself feel overwhelmed or frustrated for a short period, take a break, then get back to a problem with a clearer mind.

    <div class="topic text-justify">
      <h3>
        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?  
      </h3>
      <p>
        Just how essential Emotional Intelligence is when it comes to dealing with difficult problems. It's the difference of bouncing back with a clear mind, or pushing code around making no progress.

    <div class="topic text-justify">
      <h3>
        What was the most challenging aspects of the core learning? 
      </h3>
      <p>
        Putting it into practice was hard, getting stuck on a problem wasn't fun and only with reflection I've been able to see how to work through the situation to have a positive outcome.    
      </p>

    <div class="topic text-justify">
      <h3>
        Any thoughts you want to share about your core learning journey in Foundations?
      </h3>
      <p>
        In the beginning I didn't think too much about the core learning but over time, I've realised how important it is.
