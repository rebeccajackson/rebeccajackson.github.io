#My Reflections - Sprint Two

I set up the html and css files for my blog.  This was fairly straight-forward as I have done some html and css before.  All websites have the two basic files which are index.html for the homepage and a stylesheet (generally one for the whole website unless more are needed).  These files have to be linked in order to work on a browser. 

I did go over the original time set out as I was having trouble accessing the blog page, I managed to do it in the end.  I also have been trying to link Visual studio to git so I can open files from git.  Still struggling to do this as online instructions haven't worked thus far.


- What resources you used and why 
    I used Udacity as I learn better visually and then trying it for myself.  

- Obsticals you came up against and how you over came them
    I had learnt css Grid and Flexbox before and so was interested in the class selectors that gave the column and row sizes.  I had not done this before.

- What questions did you ask, and how was the process of solving them? 
    I usually google the questions that I have and that generally helps me fix my issue.  If not, i'll turn to someone that can help with me issue

- Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, how come?
    Yes I did keep within the timebox suggestion as I was fairly confident with html and css.

- What are of you proud of 
    I'm proud that I can focus my mind to the tasks given.

- What would you do better if you did it all over again? 
    I would try different learning methods to develop those skills.


Part One:

- Write a story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experince. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.
    I feel that HTML is like a bicycle. For a bike to work you need the framework, the wheels, a seat (hopefully), breaks, pedals etc... If you wanted to go for a ride, these need to be in the right place for it all to work.  For example, you couldn't have the handle-bars attached to pedals - that would be a disaster!  

    Now if you were a mountain-biker the CSS would be the how the bike looks and rides.  Do the pedals go round?  Is the seat comfortable? Are the wheels pumped up? These two work together to get someone from A to B, looking good as they go!

Part two:

- What obsticals you came up against and how you over came them?
    I had trouble getting the background image of my homepage to work.  I knew it needed to be in a folder called images in the same location as the .html files.  However it only worked once I got the backslash instead of a forward slash.  Such a little thing can be so annoying! 

- Any moments of surprise or joy?
    I was glad when I could get my page looking good with the right spacing and colours.  


- In addition to the challenge specific refletions, answer the following questions in your reflection:



* What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
* Which parts of the work did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
