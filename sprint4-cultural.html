    <h1>Neuroplasticity </h1>

    <div class="topic text-justify">
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is how the brain responds to training and skill development.  Our brains are not fixed - in that I mean, we don't have a set limit of knowledge or talent, but rather with practice and training, skills can be developed.
        <br>
        When people understand that their ability to learn and grow is not fixed, they are able to face challenges with positivity, knowing that even if they fail or struggle, they are still growing and learning in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        In engaging with the principles understanding these principles, I can use it to build my confidence in areas of growth.  By building on small wins, practising and repeating tasks and thoughts, I know that the neuron connects with an increase and strengthen.  In doing this I can accomplish greater challenges that I previously thought I could.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some methods used to increase neuroplasticity are practising and repeating tasks over and over.  As well as thinking through the process/challenge to develop those new neuron connections.  I found the article <a class="references" target="blank" href="https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/neuroplasticity/#learning-neuroplasticity">here</a> regarding learning and neuroplasticity very informative.

    <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

    <div class="topic text-justify"> 
      <p>
        Growth mindset (the opposite of a Fixed mindset) is a way of thinking that determines how a person approaches challenges.  They will see it as an opportunity for growth rather than a stumbling block.  Where effort and failure are a sign of growing vs a sign of defeat.  A growth mindset is key in developing neuron connections, it can also be developed with the same methods used for neuroplasticity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In researching this topic I have become more aware of the necessity of setting effort and time aside for learning a new skill or strengthening a skill that I previously had, but thought I had reached the limit of my capabilities. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I will use positive intent, practice and reflection to integrate a growth mindset in my learning journey.  With these methods, I will purposely act with the intention of growth by setting out small goals that gradually increase my confidence in my new abilities.

        This <a class="references" target="blank" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/eduardo_briceno_how_to_get_better_at_the_things_you_care_about/footnotes">Ted talk</a> is interesting as it goes further into the understanding of a growth mindset and how and when to use it to develop a skill.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>

    <div class="topic text-justify">
      <p>
        Throughout my learning plan, I would like to incorporate using a growth mindset in order to strengthen the new neuron connections for each skill.  Having this outlook can greatly improve my learning capabilities, meaning that as I approach challenges knowing that I will grow through the experience.  I will be less likely to give up when I feel overwhelmed and be more inclined to have the confidence to try find a solution.  Then by practicing and reflecting on what Iâ€™ve learnt I can hone these skills or see what areas are still weak and need further practice or understanding.
