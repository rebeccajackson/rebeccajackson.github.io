    <h1>Problem-solving </h1>

    <div class="topic text-justify">
      <p>
          The one challenge that I struggled to figure out the problem because instead of writing pseudo code to work the problem out step by step, I tried to solve the problem by just writing code and testing it until something worked.  This did mean that I got to look at a lot of error messages though.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I had a better understanding of how some of the built-in methods worked, I was able to logically think it through and write the solution without over-thinking the problem and trying to hack a lot of code together.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first problem was the gradebook kata challenge, and the second was the in-built methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        The methods I used to problem-solved were googling, trying something, and reading error messages.  I also used console.log to see what I had done to an array or object, before running a function on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the process there were time I felt a little overwhelmed but kept working methodically through the documentation I found with Google searches and when really stuck, asked peers for help.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learnt a little on each method or function that I was using, but more importantly I learnt that I need to read the documentation more and not to skim through valuable knowledge.

        I still need some more practice with using <i>Pseudo Code.</i> 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am fairly confident in <i>trying something.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have inadvertently used the <i>Rubber ducky</i>  method while trying to explain the problem to a peer and realized the solution in doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am getting better at reading <i>error messages</i> and knowing what to comment out to test a section.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Console.Logging</i> is one of my first methods of trying to solve a problem.  It helps me know to what I am working with and what parts of code are working as intended. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I often use <i>Google search</i> for answers or help on a topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Asking your peers for help</i> - I do this when I think that I might be going down a rabbit hole of misinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I havenâ€™t <i>asked coaches</i> for help yet but know that it is an option.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Improving your process with reflection</i> - I do re-read through my code to ensure that I understand it.
