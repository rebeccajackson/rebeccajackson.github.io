            <h2>My Strengths and Limitations</h2>
            <p> 
                My personal strengths are empathy, kindness and determination.  
                <br> 
                On a technical level
                - Logical thinker and I like structure. I would rather something be done sensibly than just done my way.
                - Adaptive and efficient learner.
                <br>
                <br>
                My limitations are anxiety and self-doubt.  This means I under-estimate or second guess my ability when I am actually fully capable of doing a task.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="topic text-justify">
            <h2> Goals</h2>
            <p>
                To become a successful developer, working my way up from a junior in a team to much higher levels.
                <br>
                I want the ability to potentially work remotely, to sustain a healthy work-life balance.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="topic text-justify">
            <h2>Commitment to manage workload</h2>
            <p> 
                I commit to planning and breaking down projects into manageable tasks, timeboxing my work, to search for answers and asking for help when I need it.  Approach projects with openness and positive intent. 
                <br>
                Relate to fellow learners and facilitators and industry/community representatives with honesty, a growth mindset, thoughtfulness. 
                <br>
                Track my progress by checking my skills and the EDA learning competencies.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="topic text-justify">
            <h2>Commitment to asking for help</h2>
            <p>I will seek help </p>
            <p>
                - after I have made a reasonable attempt at the work and after I have made reasonable effort to search for the answer, 
            </p>
            <p>
                - but before I reach unhelpful anxiety levels and before I waste valuable time by going around in circles.

        <div class="topic text-justify">
            <h2>Expectations from the facilitation team</h2>
            <p>
                I expect the facilitation team to follow the EDA values that they have set out:
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Empathy</i> – we care about people more than machines 
                <br>
                Take the human element into consideration if I am struggling with a task or the workload or with some other unexpected issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Learning</i> – we empower students to learn more than they thought possible 
                <br>
                Encourage me to continually grow and learn more than I think I am capable of. 
            </p> 
            <p>
                <i>Building</i> – we build beautiful and meaningful things 
                <br>
                Challenge me to think, design and build along these lines.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Feedback</i> – we listen, iterate and improve 
                <br>
                Acknowledge and respond to feedback given.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Impact</i> – we celebrate technology that improves our communities 
                <br>
                Direct me to build projects that have a meaningful and positive impact on the community around me and on the community the project will affect.
            </p>              
        </div>
        <div class="topic text-justify">
            <h2>Schedule outline</h2>
            <p>
                During Foundations I am committing time during the weekdays to complete the Sprints by the due dates.
            </p>
            <p>
                During Bootcamp I am committed to attending all classes and spending evenings and potentially time in the weekend to learning and coding.  While I will travel back and forth between Wellington and Christchurch every other weekend.  I intent to keep working while in Christchurch, but will also take time out to spend with my partner.
