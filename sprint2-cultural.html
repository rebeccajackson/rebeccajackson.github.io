        <h2>Identity, Values and Strengths</h2>
        <div class="topic">
            <p>My top five core values are:<br>
                Empathy, Growth, Thoughtfulness, Honesty and Usefulness</p>
            <p>
                My culture as a Zimbabwean has largely shaped my identity in terms of how I view the world, and people around me.  The Zimbabwean people are very friendly, respectful and community focused, and this outlook has led to my core values of empathy, usefulness and thoughtfulness.</p>
            <p> My strengths would be empathy, kindness and determination. Technically, my strengths are I am organised and intentional in my learning, I am resourceful - using     google to help me find what I need.  My limitations are anxiety and self-doubt which means I donâ€™t always speak up when I can.<br> 
                My identity has been influenced by growing up in a Zimbabwean minority group (shrinking from 0.6% when I was a child to roughly 0.1% of the total population now).  This developed my values empathy, encouraged me to continually grow and be kind to those around me. </p>
            <p>
                Another value that was influenced by my culture, is honesty.  This was formed as the government in Zimbabwe was extremely corrupt, and I could see that this type of dishonesty ruined many of lives.  As much as I can, I intent to treat others with openness and honesty.  There were constant difficult ethical situations in Zimbabwe (many involving the police) and it is hard to say what the right or wrong answer would be in those conditions. </p>
            <p>
                In my career and studies, my determination has developed as a strength.  I used to struggle with setting goals and sticking to them but in making small continuous decisions for personal-growth, I found my determination has become something I can rely on if I am stuck on a difficult task or situation. </p>
            <p>
                Expectations from Dev Academy and my Foundations facilitator: Genuine honest feedback on my progress both positive and constructive.  Helpful and supportive in my learnning journey.</p>
